In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a portioned part of a physical server that contains it's own bandwidth, OS, etc. It gives users a lot of control and privacy over their sites that are hosted there. It's affordable for those who are looking to host a site without having access to a physical server.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
