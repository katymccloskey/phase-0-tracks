# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require_relative allows us to include data from another file in the same directory
# require will search the ruby path (where gems are stored). It has a default path that it will search
require_relative 'state_data'

# Reflection Section

#What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
  # There is a hash within a hash- the STATE_DATA hash, which is a constant, and has states as the keys and hashes as the values. Those value hashs contain keys of population and pop_density, and those values are the corresponding data numbers.

#What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?

  # require_relative allows us to include data from another file in the same directory
  # require will search the ruby path (where gems are stored). It has a default path that it will search

#What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
#When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
  # each do ||
  # You don't have to pass them in as arguments, as they are availabel all throughout the class, as they are instance variables.

#What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
