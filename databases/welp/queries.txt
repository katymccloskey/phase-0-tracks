You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

 SELECT * FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> ;

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> ;

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews
   ...> INNER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> ;
Mandy|Kaling|Lotus Yoga|4|Smells like fish
Steven|Wonder|Sushi World|5|Great sake
Merryl|Streepman|The Beagle Nightclub|3|tasty fish n chips

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE businesses.name = "Lotus Yoga"
   ...> ;
