# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to see the entire history of a file or folder, including revisions made over time. It also allows us to merge changes into the original file.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch creates a copy of your original file. They are useful because you can use them to test out updates and code without affecting your original file. You can merge branches back into the master at any time, allowing you to experiment and discard things that don't work out like you thought they would.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit creates a save point in the history of your file. A good commit message is clear and concise.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when 2 different users try to edit the same file or line of code. If one user deleted a file and the other modified it, you would get a merge conflict, because Git will not know what is correct.
